# Mean-Mode-Median_Calculator
Simple Mean, Mode, and Median Calculator, made it because I sucked at doing it on paper.

Simple to use... Just open up the .py file in your text editor or IDE of choice, adjust the "listOfNumbers" list with the values which you would want.
Then, run the .py file. It'll print out the Median, Mean, and Mode. EASY AS THAT!
